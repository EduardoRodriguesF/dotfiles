# Eduardo's Dotfiles

This is the setup I use for my ArchWSL environment.

I do tinker with it a lot, so a CHANGELOG will be available soon documenting any notable change.

## Installation

You can easily cURL my files into your machine! Just run the command below:

```bash
curl -Lks https://gist.githubusercontent.com/EduardoRodriguesF/600ed2f94ad4bdba947fbdf0ca698a9e/raw | bash
```

In case you despise cURL, you can also access the same URL above, copy paste the content into your terminal and everything will be fine.

### Will I lose my files?

Nothing will be deleted nor overwritten! Every file that causes conflict will be moved to `~/.dotfiles-backup` so the checkout goes smoothly.
